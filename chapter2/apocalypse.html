            <p>Right Now,you're probably feeling pretty good. After all, 
            life in the developed world is comfortableâ€”probably more comfortable 
            than it's been for the average human being throughout all of recorded history.

            <p>But don't get too smug. There's still plenty of horrific ways it
            could all fall apart. In this article, you'll learn about a few of our
            favorites.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Mayan Doomsday</h2>
            <p>Skeptics suggest that the Mayan calendar simply rolls to a new 5,126-year era 
            after 2012, and doesn't actually predict a life-ending apocalypse. But given that the 
            long-dead Mayans were wrong about virtually everything else, why should we trust them on this?
            </p>
            
            <h2>Robot Takeover</h2>
            <p>Not quite as frightening as a Vampire Takeover or Living-Dead
            Takeover, a robot rebellion is still a disquieting thought. We are
            already outnumbered by our technological gadgets, and even Bill Gates
            fears the day his Japanese robot slave turns him over by the ankles
            and asks (in a suitably robotic voice) "Who's your daddy now?"
            </p>

            <h2>Unexplained Singularity</h2>
            <p>We don't know how the universe started, so we can't be sure it won't
            just end, maybe today, and maybe with nothing more exciting than a
            puff of anti-matter and a slight fizzing noise.
            </p>

            <h2>Runaway Climate Change</h2>ffd8 ffe0 0010 4a46 4946 0001 0100 0001

            <p>Dismissed by some, Al Gore's prophecy of doom may still come true. If
            it does, we may have to contend with vicious storms, widespread food
            shortages, and surly air conditioning repairmen.
            </p>

            <h2>Global Epidemic</h2>
            <p>Some time in the future, a lethal virus could strike. Predictions
            differ about the source of the disease, but candidates include
            monkeys in the African jungle, bioterrorists, birds and pigs with the
            flu, warriors from the future, an alien race, hospitals that use too
            many antibiotics, vampires, the CIA, and unwashed brussel sprouts.
            Whatever the source, it's clearly bad news.
